""" This script was previously called "to_drive.py" because it was used to build an archive of QC
    enrollment data on Google Drive. It also did updated GenEd information for the
    senate.qc.cuny.edu/Curriculum website. Now that QC has abandoned Google Drive (July 2022), that
    part of the code has been amputated, but the senate website update remains.

    Old Comments:
    -------------
    Upload all csv files in the "new_files" folder to the archives folder on Google Drive, and move
    them to the archive folder here.
      Based on sample code from developer.google.com/
      I don't know what command line arguments are supported by oauth2client.tools.

    The client_id.json file, which is kept outside the project, identifies the developer (Vickery).
    The first time the program runs on a computer, it will open a browser window where the user
    must agree to grant access to the program to update their Google Drive. If the user is not
    Vickery, this means setting up a folder to receive the uploads and copying the id of that folder
    into the 'parents' line below.
    (The client_id.json file has to be kept secret so that a malicious user doesn't use it to sign
    a malicious app.)

    Update: 2020-05-29
    When there is a new gened csv, copy it to the old Senate website.
